Ingredients:

For the Fried Chicken:

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 eggs, beaten
Salt and pepper to taste
Cooking oil for frying
For the Sambal (Chili Paste):

10-12 red bird's eye chilies (adjust to your preferred spice level)
4 cloves garlic
1 small shallot
1 tomato
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons cooking oil
Instructions:

For the Sambal (Chili Paste):

In a food processor or using a mortar and pestle, blend the red chilies, garlic, shallot, and tomato until it forms a smooth paste. You can adjust the number of chilies depending on your preferred spice level.

In a pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add the chili paste and sauté it until it becomes fragrant and the oil starts to separate from the paste. This can take about 5-7 minutes.

Add salt and sugar to the chili paste, mix well, and then remove it from the heat. Set the sambal aside.

For the Fried Chicken:

Start by preparing the chicken. Season the chicken with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Dredge each chicken piece in the beaten eggs and then coat them with all-purpose flour.

Heat cooking oil in a deep pan or a deep fryer to around 350-375°F (175-190°C).

Fry the chicken pieces in the hot oil until they are golden brown and crispy. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the chicken. Make sure they are cooked through and no longer pink in the center.

Once the chicken is fried, place it on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.

Assembling Ayam Geprek:

Take a fried chicken breast or thigh and place it on a clean cutting board.

Using a pestle or the back of a spoon, gently smash the fried chicken, breaking it into smaller pieces. Be careful not to smash it too hard; you want it to remain somewhat intact.

Spread a generous amount of the sambal (chili paste) over the smashed chicken.

Serve your Ayam Geprek with steamed rice, fresh vegetables, and a wedge of lime. Enjoy the delicious combination of crispy, spicy, and savory flavors!

Note: Adjust the level of spiciness in the sambal by adding or reducing the number of red chilies. Ayam Geprek is typically served very spicy, so adjust to your taste preference.
