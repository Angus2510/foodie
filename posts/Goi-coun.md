Ingredients:

For the Filling:

8-10 rice paper wrappers (8-inch or 22cm size)
16-20 cooked medium-sized shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 cup cooked rice vermicelli (Bun)
1 cup bean sprouts
Fresh herbs (mint, cilantro, basil, and perilla leaves)
1 small cucumber, julienned
1 carrot, julienned
Lettuce leaves
For the Dipping Sauce (Nuoc Cham):

3 tablespoons fish sauce
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1-2 Thai red chilies, minced (adjust to your spice preference)
Instructions:

Preparing the Filling:

Cook the rice vermicelli (Bun) according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.

Set up a clean, flat surface for assembling the rolls. A large plate or shallow tray can work well.

Rolling the Goi Cuon:

Fill a large, shallow bowl with warm water. The water should be warm but not too hot to handle.

Dip one rice paper wrapper into the warm water for about 5-10 seconds, or until it becomes soft and pliable.

Lay the softened rice paper flat on your working surface.

Place 2 shrimp halves (or whole if they are small), cut side down, on the lower third of the rice paper.

Above the shrimp, add a small portion of vermicelli noodles, a handful of bean sprouts, and a few fresh herb leaves.

Add a few julienned cucumber and carrot slices.

Carefully fold the sides of the rice paper over the filling, then lift the bottom of the rice paper and tightly roll everything into a neat cylinder, similar to rolling a burrito.

Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients.

Preparing the Dipping Sauce (Nuoc Cham):

In a bowl, combine fish sauce, water, sugar, lime juice, minced garlic, and minced chilies. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

Adjust the taste with more sugar, lime, or water to achieve the right balance of flavors.

Serving:

Cut the Goi Cuon rolls in half diagonally and serve with a side of Nuoc Cham dipping sauce.
Enjoy your homemade Goi Cuon, a refreshing and healthy Vietnamese appetizer or light meal!
