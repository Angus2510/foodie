8 cups water
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 cloves garlic, minced
2-inch piece of ginger, sliced
2-3 stalks lemongrass, smashed
2-3 kaffir lime leaves (optional)
1-2 tablespoons cooking oil

Lime wedges
Instructions:

Preparing the Chicken and Broth:

In a large pot, combine the whole chicken, water, salt, sugar, minced garlic, sliced ginger, smashed lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves (if using).

Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer. Cook for about 30-45 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.

Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool. Shred the chicken meat and set it aside.

Strain the broth to remove the solids and return it to the pot. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and sugar if needed.

Seasoning the Chicken:

In a bowl, mix the shredded chicken with minced garlic, salt, and white pepper. Set it aside to marinate.
Cooking the Noodles:

Cook the fresh egg noodles (mie ayam noodles) according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.
Serving Mie Ayam:

To serve, divide the cooked noodles among serving bowls.

Top the noodles with the marinated shredded chicken.

Drizzle with soy sauce and/or sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) to taste.

Garnish with fried shallots, chopped green onions, sliced chilies (if you like it spicy), and fried garlic (optional).

Serve with lime wedges on the side.

Pour hot chicken broth into the serving bowls to cover the noodles and toppings.

Enjoy your homemade Mie Ayam, a delightful Indonesian chicken noodle soup filled with rich flavors and comforting warmth!
