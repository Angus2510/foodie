Ingredients:

For the Sandwich:

1 French baguette or Vietnamese banh mi rolls
1/2 pound (225g) roast pork, thinly sliced (or use grilled chicken, beef, or tofu for variations)
1 cucumber, thinly sliced
2-3 radishes, thinly sliced
2-3 fresh jalapeño peppers, thinly sliced
Fresh cilantro leaves
Pickled daikon and carrot (recipe below)
Mayonnaise and/or pâté (optional)
Fresh lime wedges for serving
For the Pickled Daikon and Carrot:

1 cup daikon radish, julienned
1 cup carrot, julienned
1/2 cup white vinegar
1/2 cup water
1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
For the Banh Mi Sauce:

3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
1 clove garlic, minced
1-2 Thai red chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference)
Instructions:

For the Pickled Daikon and Carrot:

In a bowl, combine the julienned daikon and carrot.

In a separate bowl, mix together the vinegar, water, sugar, and salt until the sugar and salt dissolve.

Pour the vinegar mixture over the daikon and carrot and let them sit for at least 30 minutes, or longer for a stronger pickled flavor. Drain before using.

For the Banh Mi Sauce:

In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, minced garlic, and chopped Thai chilies. Adjust the chili amount to suit your spice preference. Set aside.
Assembling the Banh Mi:

Slice the baguette into individual sandwich-sized portions.

If desired, spread a thin layer of mayonnaise and/or pâté on the baguette.

Layer the roast pork (or your choice of protein) onto the bread.

Add a generous portion of pickled daikon and carrot.

Place slices of cucumber, radishes, and fresh jalapeño peppers on top.

Drizzle the Banh Mi sauce over the ingredients.

Finish with a handful of fresh cilantro leaves.

Squeeze fresh lime juice over the sandwich for a burst of citrus flavor.

Close the sandwich, and it's ready to serve!

Enjoy your homemade Banh Mi, a delicious combination of textures and flavors, from the crispy baguette to the savory protein and the tangy pickled vegetables. It's a delightful taste of Vietnam in every bite.
