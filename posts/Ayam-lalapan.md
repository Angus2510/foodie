Ingredients:

For the Fried Chicken:

1 whole chicken, cut into serving pieces
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
Cooking oil for deep frying
For the Sambal (Chili Paste):

10-12 red bird's eye chilies (adjust to your preferred spice level)
4 cloves garlic
1 small shallot
1 tomato
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons cooking oil
For the Vegetables:

Slices of cucumber
Slices of tomato
Lettuce leaves
Instructions:

For the Sambal (Chili Paste):

In a food processor or using a mortar and pestle, blend the red chilies, garlic, shallot, and tomato until it forms a smooth paste. Adjust the number of chilies to your preferred spice level.

In a pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add the chili paste and sauté it until it becomes fragrant and the oil starts to separate from the paste. This typically takes about 5-7 minutes.

Add salt and sugar to the chili paste, mix well, and then remove it from the heat. Set the sambal aside.

For the Fried Chicken:

Season the chicken pieces with salt and black pepper. You can marinate the chicken with these seasonings for added flavor if you have time.

Heat cooking oil in a deep pan or a deep fryer to around 350-375°F (175-190°C).

Fry the chicken pieces in batches until they are golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). This should take about 12-15 minutes per batch. Make sure they are cooked through and no longer pink in the center.

Place the fried chicken pieces on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.

Assembling Ayam Lalapan:

Arrange the fried chicken on a serving plate.

Serve the Ayam Lalapan with fresh slices of cucumber, tomato, and lettuce leaves on the side.

Offer the sambal (chili paste) in a small dish or bowl for dipping. Guests can dip the chicken and vegetables into the spicy sambal according to their preferred spice level.

Ayam Lalapan is typically served with steamed rice or lontong (compressed rice cakes) as a side.

Enjoy this delightful Indonesian dish, a perfect balance of crispy, spicy, and fresh flavors!
