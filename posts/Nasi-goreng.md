Ingredients:

3 cups cold, cooked jasmine rice (day-old rice works best)
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu (optional)
1/2 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, bell peppers)
2-3 tablespoons sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)
1-2 tablespoons regular soy sauce
1 teaspoon shrimp paste (terasi) or fish sauce (optional)
1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
Sliced cucumber and tomato for garnish (optional)
Sliced green onions for garnish
Sambal or sliced chili (optional, for extra heat)
Instructions:

Heat the Wok:

Heat the cooking oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.
Stir-Fry Aromatics:

Add minced garlic and chopped onions to the wok. Stir-fry until they become fragrant and the onions turn translucent.
Add Protein and Vegetables:

If you're using cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu, add it to the wok and stir-fry until heated through.

Add the mixed vegetables and continue to stir-fry until they begin to soften.

Push Ingredients to the Side:

Push the protein and vegetables to one side of the wok, creating an empty space in the center.
Scramble the Eggs:

Pour the lightly beaten eggs into the empty space in the wok. Scramble them until they are mostly cooked.
Mix Everything Together:

Mix the scrambled eggs with the protein and vegetables in the wok.
Add Cooked Rice:

Add the cold, cooked jasmine rice to the wok. Break up any clumps and stir-fry to combine all the ingredients.
Season with Sauces:

Drizzle sweet soy sauce (kecap manis) and regular soy sauce over the rice. Stir-fry to evenly coat the rice.
Flavor with Shrimp Paste (Optional):

If using shrimp paste or fish sauce for an extra layer of umami, add it to the wok and stir-fry to distribute the flavor.
Season with Ground Pepper:

Season the Nasi Goreng with ground white pepper. Stir to mix.
Taste and Adjust:

Taste the fried rice and adjust the seasoning by adding more soy sauce, kecap manis, or pepper to your preference.
Garnish and Serve:

Serve the Nasi Goreng hot, garnished with sliced cucumber, tomato, sliced green onions, and a side of sambal or sliced chili for those who prefer extra heat.
