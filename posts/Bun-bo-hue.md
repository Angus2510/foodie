Instructions:

Preparing the Broth:

In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the beef shank, pork knuckle, and beef bones. Boil for about 10-15 minutes to remove any impurities.

Drain and rinse the meat and bones. Clean the pot and return the meat and bones to it.

Add lemongrass, ginger, unpeeled onion, and unpeeled garlic to the pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover all the ingredients.

Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.

Simmer the broth for about 3-4 hours, occasionally adding water to maintain the water level.

After simmering, remove the meat and bones from the pot. Slice the beef shank thinly. Discard the ginger, lemongrass, and onion, and peel the garlic.

Return the beef slices to the pot.

Add Bun Bo Hue spice mix, shrimp paste, fish sauce, sugar, and salt to the broth. Let it simmer for another 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Adjust the seasonings to taste.

Preparing the Noodles:

Prepare the round rice noodles according to the package instructions.

Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process.

Serving:

Place a portion of cooked noodles in a serving bowl.

Arrange slices of beef shank and pork blood jelly (if using) on top of the noodles.

Ladle the hot broth over the meat and noodles.

Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, cilantro, lime wedges, sliced green onions, and sliced red chilies. Diners can add these toppings to their soup according to their preferences.

Enjoy your homemade Bun Bo Hue, a tantalizing Vietnamese noodle soup with rich and spicy flavors!

Note: Bun Bo Hue spice mix and shrimp paste (mam ruoc) can be found in Asian markets. Adjust the spiciness by adding more or fewer chilies and chili oil to suit your taste.
