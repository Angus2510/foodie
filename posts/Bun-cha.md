Ingredients:

For the Grilled Pork:

1 pound (450g) ground pork
1/2 pound (225g) pork belly, thinly sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 shallot, minced
2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 stalk lemongrass, minced (white part only)
1-2 tablespoons oil for grilling
For the Dipping Sauce (Nuoc Mam Cham):

2 tablespoons fish sauce
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/2 cup water
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1-2 Thai red chilies, minced (adjust to your spice preference)
Fresh lime juice, to taste
For Serving:

Cooked rice vermicelli (Bun)
Fresh herbs (lettuce, mint, cilantro, Thai basil)
Sliced cucumber
Shredded carrot
Bean sprouts
Sliced green onions
Crushed peanuts (optional)
Instructions:

Preparing the Grilled Pork:

In a bowl, combine minced garlic, minced shallot, fish sauce, sugar, honey, black pepper, salt, and minced lemongrass.

Add the ground pork to the mixture and mix until well combined. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or longer for more flavor.

Shape the marinated pork mixture into small, flattened meat patties (about the size of a tablespoon).

Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking.

Grill the meat patties and thinly sliced pork belly until they're cooked through and have grill marks, about 2-3 minutes on each side.

Preparing the Dipping Sauce (Nuoc Mam Cham):

In a bowl, combine fish sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, water, minced garlic, and minced chilies. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

Adjust the taste with fresh lime juice to balance the sweetness and saltiness. Set aside.

Serving:

Cook the rice vermicelli (Bun) according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water.

Divide the cooked vermicelli among serving bowls.

Arrange the grilled pork patties and sliced pork belly on top of the vermicelli.

Serve with a side of fresh herbs, sliced cucumber, shredded carrot, bean sprouts, and sliced green onions.

Provide the dipping sauce and crushed peanuts (optional) on the side.

To enjoy, diners can dip the grilled pork into the dipping sauce and pair it with a combination of rice vermicelli and fresh herbs and vegetables.

Enjoy your homemade Bun Cha, a delightful Vietnamese dish with a perfect balance of flavors and textures!
