Ingredients:

For the Broth:

2 large onions, peeled and halved
4-5 slices of fresh ginger (each about the size of a quarter)
4-6 cloves of garlic, peeled
4-5 star anise pods
4-5 cloves
1 cinnamon stick
8 cups beef broth (homemade or store-bought)
4 cups water
2-3 tablespoons fish sauce
1-2 tablespoons sugar
Salt, to taste
For the Pho Bowl:

8 oz (225g) dried rice noodles (banh pho)
1/2 pound (225g) beef (sirloin, brisket, or eye of round), thinly sliced
Thinly sliced white onion
Fresh herbs (cilantro, Thai basil, mint)
Bean sprouts
Lime wedges
Sliced red chilies (optional)
Hoisin sauce (for dipping)
Sriracha sauce (for dipping)
Instructions:

Broth Preparation:

Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Place the halved onions, ginger slices, and garlic cloves on a baking sheet. Roast them in the oven until they develop a charred appearance, about 15-20 minutes.

In a dry skillet, toast the star anise pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick over medium heat for a few minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.

In a large stockpot, combine the roasted onions, ginger, and garlic with the toasted spices. Add the beef broth, water, fish sauce, and sugar.

Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to simmer. Cover and let it simmer for at least 1-2 hours to allow the flavors to develop.

Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning by adding more fish sauce, sugar, or salt to your preference. The broth should be savory with a hint of sweetness.

Preparing the Rice Noodles:

Cook the dried rice noodles (banh pho) according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking process.
Serving Pho:

To serve, divide the cooked rice noodles among serving bowls.

Arrange thinly sliced raw beef on top of the noodles. The hot broth will cook the beef slices when poured over them.

Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and beef. The hot broth will cook the beef slices as you pour.

Top the Pho with thinly sliced white onion and fresh herbs (cilantro, Thai basil, and mint).

Serve bean sprouts, lime wedges, sliced red chilies (for those who prefer extra heat), hoisin sauce, and Sriracha sauce on the side.

Diners can customize their Pho with their choice of toppings and seasonings.

Enjoy your homemade Pho, a delicious and aromatic Vietnamese beef noodle soup!
