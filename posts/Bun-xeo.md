1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 can (14 oz) of coconut milk (approximately 1 3/4 cups)
1 1/2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 green onions, thinly sliced
Cooking oil for frying
For the Filling:

1/2 pound (225g) pork belly, thinly sliced
1/2 pound (225g) medium-sized shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 small onion, thinly sliced
1 cup bean sprouts
Fresh herbs (mint, cilantro, perilla leaves, or any herbs you prefer)
Lettuce leaves
For the Dipping Sauce (Nuoc Cham):

3 tablespoons fish sauce
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons sugar
2 tablespoons lime juice
1 clove garlic, minced
1-2 Thai red chilies, minced (adjust to your spice preference)
Instructions:

Preparing the Pancake Batter:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, cornstarch, turmeric powder, and salt.

Gradually add the coconut milk and water while whisking to create a smooth, thin batter.

Stir in the sliced green onions and let the batter rest for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

Making the Pancakes:

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and add a bit of cooking oil.

Add a few slices of pork belly and cook until they start to brown and release their fat.

Add sliced onions and shrimp, and cook until the shrimp turn pink and the onions become translucent.

Push the cooked ingredients to one side of the skillet.

Pour a ladle of the pancake batter into the skillet, swirling it to coat the bottom evenly.

Cover the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes until the pancake becomes crispy and golden.

Fold the pancake in half to encase the filling.

Remove the pancake from the skillet and keep it warm.

Repeat the process with the remaining batter and filling.

Preparing the Dipping Sauce (Nuoc Cham):

In a bowl, combine fish sauce, water, sugar, lime juice, minced garlic, and minced chilies. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

Adjust the taste with more sugar, lime, or water as needed to achieve the right balance of flavors.

Serving:

To serve, cut the Banh Xeo into manageable portions.

Place each piece on a lettuce leaf and top with bean sprouts and fresh herbs.

Roll the pancake like a spring roll and dip in the Nuoc Cham sauce.

Enjoy your homemade Banh Xeo, a delightful Vietnamese savory pancake filled with a variety of flavors and textures!
