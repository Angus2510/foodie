Ingredients:

For the Meatballs:

250g ground beef (or a combination of beef and chicken)
100g tapioca starch or cornstarch
1 egg
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/2 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 cup ice water
For the Broth:

8 cups beef broth (homemade or store-bought)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp beef or chicken bouillon (optional, for extra flavor)
A few slices of fried shallots (optional)
For Serving:

Cooked egg noodles or rice vermicelli, prepared according to package instructions
Bok choy or Chinese cabbage, blanched
Fried shallots
Sambal (chili sauce)
Sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)
Lime wedges
Fried or boiled dumplings (optional)
Instructions:

For the Meatballs:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, tapioca starch (or cornstarch), minced garlic, salt, pepper, sugar, and baking powder.

Crack the egg into the mixture and gradually add the ice water while continuously stirring. The mixture should become smooth and elastic.

Wet your hands and shape the meat mixture into small meatballs, about the size of a golf ball. Place the meatballs on a tray or plate lined with plastic wrap.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop the meatballs into the boiling water and cook them for about 10-15 minutes, or until they float and are fully cooked.

Once cooked, remove the meatballs from the water and set them aside.

For the Broth:

In a separate pot, heat the beef broth over medium heat. Add minced garlic, salt, pepper, sugar, and bouillon if using. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes to infuse the flavors.

Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

To Serve:

Prepare the cooked egg noodles or rice vermicelli according to the package instructions.

Place a portion of noodles in a serving bowl and add blanched bok choy or Chinese cabbage.

Arrange several meatballs on top of the noodles.

Ladle the hot broth over the meatballs and noodles.

Garnish with fried shallots and serve with sambal, sweet soy sauce, lime wedges, and fried or boiled dumplings if desired.

Enjoy your homemade Bakso, a comforting and hearty Indonesian meatball soup!
