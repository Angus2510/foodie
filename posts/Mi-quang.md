1-2 slices of ginger
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
8-10 cups water
For the Turmeric Noodles:

8-10 oz (225-280g) thick rice noodles (Mi Quang noodles)
1-2 tablespoons turmeric powder
1-2 tablespoons cooking oil
For the Toppings:

Cooked and sliced pork (from the broth)
Cooked and shredded chicken (from the broth)
Shrimp, peeled and deveined
Quail eggs, hard-boiled and peeled (optional)
Roasted peanuts, crushed
Fresh herbs (mint, cilantro, basil)
Bean sprouts
Banana flower, thinly sliced (optional)
Lime wedges

For the Dipping Sauce:

3 tablespoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon lime juice
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1-2 Thai red chilies, minced (adjust to your spice preference)
Instructions:

Making the Broth:

In a large pot, bring 8-10 cups of water to a boil.

Add the chicken thighs and/or pork to the boiling water. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.

Add the onion, lemongrass, ginger, salt, and sugar to the pot. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot. Cook for about 30-45 minutes, or until the meat is fully cooked.

Remove the cooked meat from the broth, slice it, and set it aside.

Making the Turmeric Noodles:

Cook the thick rice noodles (Mi Quang noodles) according to the package instructions.

Rinse the cooked noodles with cold water to stop the cooking process.

In a bowl, mix the cooked noodles with turmeric powder and cooking oil until the noodles are evenly coated and have a vibrant yellow color.

Preparing the Dipping Sauce:

In a bowl, combine fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, minced garlic, and minced chilies. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

Adjust the taste with more sugar, lime, or water to achieve the right balance of flavors.

Serving Mi Quang:

To serve, divide the turmeric-coated noodles among serving bowls.

Top the noodles with slices of cooked meat, shrimp, and quail eggs (if using).

Add fresh herbs, banana flower slices (if using), bean sprouts, and crushed peanuts.

Serve with lime wedges, chili slices, and the dipping sauce on the side.

Enjoy your homemade Mi Quang, a flavorful and vibrant Vietnamese noodle soup!
