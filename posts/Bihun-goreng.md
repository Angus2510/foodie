Ingredients:

200g rice vermicelli (bihun)
2 tablespoons cooking oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 small onion, thinly sliced
100g chicken, shrimp, or tofu (or a combination), diced
1 carrot, julienned
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2-3 tablespoons sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)
2-3 tablespoons regular soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
1/4 teaspoon white pepper
A handful of bean sprouts (tauge), rinsed and drained
Sliced green onions for garnish
Lime wedges for serving (optional)
Instructions:

Prepare the Rice Vermicelli:

Soak the rice vermicelli in warm water for about 5-7 minutes, or until it softens. Drain and set aside.
Stir-Fry:

Heat the cooking oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat.

Add minced garlic and sliced onion. Saut√© until fragrant and the onions turn translucent.

Add the diced chicken, shrimp, or tofu, and stir-fry until the protein is cooked through.

Push the cooked meat or tofu to one side of the wok and pour the beaten eggs into the other side. Scramble the eggs until they're mostly cooked, and then mix them with the meat or tofu.

Add the julienned carrot and thinly sliced red bell pepper to the wok. Stir-fry for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften.

Seasoning:

Add sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), regular soy sauce, sugar, salt, and white pepper to the wok. Stir to combine all the ingredients.
Adding the Rice Vermicelli:

Toss the drained rice vermicelli into the wok with the other ingredients.

Stir-fry everything together, making sure the noodles are evenly coated with the sauce. If the noodles seem too dry, you can add a little more soy sauce.

Finishing Touches:

Add the bean sprouts (tauge) and continue to stir-fry for another minute or so until they start to wilt.

Taste and adjust the seasoning with more soy sauce, sugar, or salt if necessary.

Serving:

Serve the Bihun Goreng hot, garnished with sliced green onions. You can also serve it with lime wedges for an extra burst of citrus flavor.
Enjoy your homemade Bihun Goreng, a delightful Indonesian stir-fried rice vermicelli dish filled with flavors and textures!
