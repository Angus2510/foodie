Ingredients:

1 pound (450g) pork shoulder or pork belly, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons cooking oil
1 onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1-inch piece of ginger, grated
2 tablespoons sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)
2 tablespoons regular soy sauce
2 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 tablespoons tamarind paste
1 teaspoon brown sugar
1/2 cup water
Salt and pepper to taste
Sliced green onions for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

In a large skillet or wok, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat.

Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Saut√© them until they become fragrant and the onions turn translucent.

Add the pork pieces to the skillet and cook them until they are lightly browned on all sides. This should take about 5-7 minutes.

In a small bowl, mix together the sweet soy sauce (kecap manis), regular soy sauce, oyster sauce, tamarind paste, and brown sugar.

Pour the sauce mixture over the pork and stir well to coat the meat evenly.

Add the water to the skillet, stir, and bring the mixture to a simmer.

Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the pork simmer for about 45-60 minutes, or until the meat becomes tender and the sauce thickens. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and burning.

Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve Babi Kecap over steamed rice and garnish with sliced green onions, if desired.

Enjoy this flavorful and aromatic Indonesian dish that balances the sweetness of kecap manis with the savory richness of the pork. It's a delicious way to explore the unique flavors of Indonesian cuisine.
